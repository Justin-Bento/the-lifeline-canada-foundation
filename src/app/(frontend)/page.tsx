                  A Pattern Interrupt is a way to alter our mental, emotional,
                  or behavioral state in order to break negative habits. Pattern
                  interrupts offer an effective way to break negative cycles and
                  regain control over our actions, thoughts, and emotions. By
                  recognizing our patterns, we can intervene and create new
                  pathways for more productive thoughts, behaviors, and emotions
                  and make lasting changes in our lives.

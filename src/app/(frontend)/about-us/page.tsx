      <p className="">Our strength is collaboration</p>
      <p className="">
        We believe that our strength lies in our collaborative approach, which
        puts our clients at the center of everything we do.

        Studio was started by three friends who noticed that developer studios
        were charging clients double what an in-house team would cost. Since the
        beginning, we have been committed to doing things differently by
        charging triple instead.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        At Studio, we’re more than just colleagues — we’re a family. This means
        we pay very little and expect people to work late. We want our employees
        to bring their whole selves to work. In return, we just ask that they
        keep themselves there until at least 6:30pm.

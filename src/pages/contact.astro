        The LifeLine Canada Foundation (TLC) is a registered non-profit
        committed to the prevention of suicide and positive mental health in
        Canada and Worldwide and has made work in this area a top priority. We
        envision a country where suicide is a rare event, where people are
        nurtured and supported, where individuals and families are aware of the
        risk factors for suicide and actively seek help from accessible,
        effective community resources.

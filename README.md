# The LifeLine Canada Foundation aka TLC

The LifeLine Canada Foundation (or TLC) is a registered non-profit, committed to positive mental health and suicide prevention & awareness and is constantly developing new initiatives in support of these goals. The LifeLine Canada Foundation is not a crisis hotline. If in Crisis, call or text 988 for Canada’s new suicide prevention hotline. If you or someone you know is in danger of hurting themselves or others, call 911 immediately. See our directory of [mental health crisis support](https://thelifelinecanada.ca/incrisisneedhelp/) in your area.

The App is currently in development sage and.



## Installation

Before you install The Lifeline App, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed on your machine.

> **Note:** I recommend using `asdf` to install Node.js so that you can easily manage different versions of Node.js and Expo for this project. 

### Step 1: Set Up a Development Directory (Optional)
If you're using Linux or WSL, you might want to create a dedicated directory for all your development projects:

```bash
mkdir development
```
head into the development direcotry
```bash
cd development
```

Before cloning the repository, it's a good practice to fork it to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes in your own copy of the repository without affecting the original one.

1. Go to the [Lifeline App GitHub repository](https://github.com/Justin-Bento/the-lifeline-canada-foundation).

3. Once the fork is created, you'll have your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

Navigate to the development or your preferred directory, then clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Justin-Bento/the-lifeline-canada-foundation.git

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
